# Intro

Hello, I'm a French cybersecurity professional studying for OSCP for the past few months. I am mostly training on HackTheBox and taking notes on CherryTree but wanted to make all of this prettier.  
You'll find plenty of cheatsheets regarding OSCP on the web, this one is far from exhaustive nor finished, but it's mine and I'm planning to update it as long as I'm not done with the certification ! Bonus if it helps someone :)  
If something's wrong or you have suggestions, feel free to reach me.
